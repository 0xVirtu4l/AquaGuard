## Overview

AquaGuard is your essential companion for responsible water recreation. It offers the following key features:

![Sea Creatures Section](https://github.com/0xVirtu4l/AquaGuard/assets/76711572/0fcb19b1-65ee-4a39-bc12-1413e4f180e4)


**Sea Creatures Section**: Explore and learn about the fascinating aquatic species you encounter during your water adventures. From Atlantic Salmon to American Eel, AquaGuard helps you identify these creatures, discover their habitats, and understand their conservation status.

![Water Highlights Section](https://github.com/0xVirtu4l/AquaGuard/assets/76711572/25927718-37cd-4c4a-b321-8ba3ca8b934e)


**Water Highlights Section**: Get real-time insights into the water you're swimming in. AquaGuard provides information about water quality, including parameters like Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), temperature, harmful algal blooms (HABs), and more. Make informed decisions about your water-based activities.

![Current Info Section](https://github.com/0xVirtu4l/AquaGuard/assets/76711572/957610ae-5183-4e10-b3a2-fd39ea9e96ec)


**Current Info Section**: Understand the origins of the water in your area. AquaGuard allows you to learn where the water originates and its journey to your location. Explore the impact of currents, rivers, and oceans on the water you swim in.

## Current Location Button
![Current Location Button](https://github.com/0xVirtu4l/AquaGuard/assets/76711572/980cb127-08f7-4b46-9cd8-0790a7fa29a0)

AquaGuard features a "Current Location" button that allows you to discover the nearest water area based on your location. Here's how it works:

1. When you click on the "Current Location" button, AquaGuard will use your device's GPS or location services to determine your current geographic coordinates.

2. Once your coordinates are obtained, AquaGuard will search for the nearest water area or body of water around you location.

3. It will take the name of the nearest water area and will search for it in the database.This database contains information about various water bodies, including lakes, rivers, seas, and more.

4. AquaGuard will then display the name of the nearest water area on the screen. For example, if you're in New York, USA, it might show "Cayuga Lake" as the nearest water area.

5. You can further explore the water quality, aquatic species, and more details related to this specific water area by using AquaGuard's intuitive interface.
